# Metal-Surface-Defects-Classification
This is a project for classification of six types of metal surface defects using a CNN model. Different type of CNN architecture were tried and fine tuned for best accuracy and F1 score.

This dataset was downloaded from NEU Metal Surface Defects Databse which contains six kinds of typical surface defects of the hot-rolled steel strip are collected, i.e., rolled-in scale (RS), patches (Pa), crazing (Cr), pitted surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). The database includes 1,800 grayscale images: 300 samples each of six different kinds of typical surface defects.

But for this analysis, the dataset divided into 3 directories. The training directory contains 276 images of each class from the 300 images. The rest 24 images of each class also divided into tests and valid datasets.
